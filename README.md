# Random Quote Generator

In this Project, I learned:
1. Position: static, relative, absolute
2. Use of Min and Max Height and Width.
3. Use of Async-Await to fetch Data from an API and then convert that data response to JSON and then use it to update the Content of HTML Tags. 
4. Use of `Windows.open()`
